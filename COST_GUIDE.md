## 🔐 How Credentials Work

### On Apify Platform (Recommended)

**User's Experience:**
```
1. User visits your Actor page
2. Clicks "Try for free" or "Run"
3. Fills input:
   - Search terms: "Plumbers in NYC"
   - Max items: 100
   - Proxy: [Dropdown shows THEIR proxy options]
     • Residential (their account)
     • Datacenter (their account)
     • None (not recommended)
4. Clicks "Start"
5. Actor runs using THEIR credentials automatically
```

**Behind the Scenes:**
```javascript
// Your code (main.js)
const proxyConfig = await Actor.createProxyConfiguration({
    ...proxyConfiguration, // ← Apify injects USER's credentials here!
});

// User never sees or needs YOUR credentials
// You never see or access THEIR credentials
// Perfect isolation! 🔒
```

**Cost Distribution:**
- Actor runs on Apify servers: **User pays compute**
- Uses Apify Proxy: **User's proxy credits deducted**
- Stores results: **User's storage quota**
- Your cost: **$0** ✅

---

### Local Development (Advanced Users)

**If User Downloads Your Code:**

```bash
# They create THEIR OWN .env file
cat > .env << EOF
APIFY_TOKEN=their_own_token_here
APIFY_PROXY_PASSWORD=their_password  # Optional, auto-fetched from token
EOF

# Run locally
npm start
```

**Cost:**
- Compute: Free (their local machine)
- Proxy: From their Apify account
- Your cost: **$0** ✅
